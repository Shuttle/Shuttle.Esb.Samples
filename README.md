Shuttle.Esb.Samples
===================

Samples that illustrate how to effectively use Shuttle ESB.

When using Visual Studio 2015+ the NuGet packages should be restored automatically.  If you find that they do not or if you are using an older version of Visual Studio please execute the following in a Visual Studio command prompt:

~~~
cd {extraction-folder}\Shuttle.Esb.Samples\{sample-folder}
nuget restore
~~~

There is a `README.md` file in each sample project folder that will provide more information on running the sample along with additional information pertaining to the sample.
